# Prototype 03 (Revised)

### Design Hypothesis

_How can I further elaborate on my narrative prototype to give the illusion of agency to the player?_

My preceding prototype consisted of working around visual and sound effects to create the core gameplay. Based on my previous playtesters’ responses, I wanted to add further interactive options for the player to let them explore the narrative world.  In this prototype, the player can now “choose” to consume their pills or not and interact with monsters. By interacting with the monsters, they will have a broader sense of the backstory of the game. I also added the game controls at the beginning to ease them into the game. Although the player is given choices, this will not affect the gameplay as it does not diverge the storyline. 

**Changes implemented:**
- Dialogues
- Options
- More SFX
- Game Controls display

**Questions:**
1. Were you able to grasp the general story of the game so far?
2. Although there is an option to take pills, the main character forgot to bring them. Do you think there should still be an option for them to regain sanity? (i.e by staying under the lamp post for x amount of time)
3. How do you feel about the game pacing? Is it too slow/fast or just right?
4. Did you encounter any issues?
5. Any comments or recommendations to improve my game? :>


**Feedback & Reflection**

For the iterative prototype, I allowed the player to feel a sense of agency by giving them options in the gameplay. From my playtest, I was able to learn that most playtesters wanted to be able to juggle between being sane and insane.Being able to achieve things depending on your current state is something they wanted to see and experience. Therefore, I believe I should slightly change the way I approach my game. Thankfully, the narrative of the game was understood by all my playtesters and they were able to grasp the general story of the game. The pacing of the game seems to be just right and I think for the final version, I will be focusing on expanding the map, completing the storyline and balancing the gameplay from the player’s sanity. One issue that players kept encountering was a bug (or more like a forgot to add) feature where the player’s movement would be frozen after selecting a dialogue option. I have since fixed it! 

Here are some suggestions made by playtesters:
- Bigger text and button
- Random monster voices
- Monsters following you
- Brighter Map
- Move camera angle
- More interaction
- Complete storyline

Here are the changes I decided to implement:
- Bigger map & UI
- Regaining sanity under certain conditions
- Completed storyline
- Multiple endings
- More interactions 
- Menu screen

# Prototype 03 (Original)

### Design Hypothesis

_Can I push a narrative to a game only by making use of visual and sound effect aspects?_

For the last prototype, I explored the PostProcessing render effects in a 2D world. I wanted to set up a spooky ambience to create an atmospheric game environment by combining visual and sound effects. In addition, I tried implementing different states in the games that are triggered by the player. 

**Questions**  

1. What do you think is the narrative of the game?
2. What genre of game would you consider this game to be (now or in the future)?
3. Did you feel lost at some point while playing?
4. Do you think adding instructions would be necessary for this prototype?
5. How do you feel about the overall environment and ambience?
6. For aesthetic purposes, the prototype color palette is very dark and gloomy. Do you think it is appropriate or do you have any issues regarding this matter?
7. Were there any other issues you noticed or wanted to comment on?
8. Any suggestions to improve the gameplay?   

**Feedback & Reflection**

By introducing the player to a simple game mechanism (wasd, spacebar and button control), I was able to focus on  creating a narrative by utilizing unity visual effects (PostProcessing) within a 2D world. Here are some discoveries that I have made from the playtest reponses:


Having no “true end-goal” in this game, the player was met with simple game mechanisms to interact with such as moving the character and deciding to take their pills (which their only option was no) by pressing a button. I was curious as to what they would think the game narrative would be about and here are a few theories from them:
Refusing to take the pills will slowly make the character lose sanity and see monsters, but the monsters are actually real
Refusing to take pills to hangout with your hallucinated friends
Their theories are actually very similar to what I was aiming for, therefore I believe I was able to convey my message to the receptors. All of my playtesters were able to figure out that I was going for a narrative/spooky type of game. 

For this prototype, I did not give out any instructions and wanted to let the player explore by using their intuition. The only sort of instruction they were getting was the button to not take their pills. Most of my playtesters thought the gameplay was self-explanatory, but weren’t sure what to do next, mostly because the prototype was not completed and did not have a definite end-goal. Some of my playtesters mentioned showing the controls scheme and having some sort of simple indication to where the player should go next. I think by adding some arrows or in-game elements such as road signs that act as instruction will be beneficial in my case. 

Overall, the playtesters enjoyed the overall environment and ambience of my prototype. I was afraid that the opacity would’ve been too low, but my playtesters reassured me that the brightness was at a good level and fit well with the narrative.The major recurring issue was the button not being responsive at times and the hover/click effect was not as noticeable and the text being too small to read. 

Here are some suggestions provided by my playtesters:
- Providing an option to take the pills
- Bigger map and different location
- Interacting with monsters
- Look for objects (more interaction between player and environnement)
