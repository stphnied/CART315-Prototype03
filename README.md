# Prototype 03

### Design Hypothesis

For the last prototype, I explored the PostProcessing render effects in a 2D world. I wanted to set up a spooky ambience to create an atmospheric game environment by combining visual and sound effects. In addition, I tried implementing different states in the games that are triggered by the player. 

**Questions**  

1. What do you think is the narrative of the game?
2. What genre of game would you consider this game to be (now or in the future)?
3. Did you feel lost at some point while playing?
4. Do you think adding instructions would be necessary for this prototype?
5. How do you feel about the overall environment and ambience?
6. For aesthetic purposes, the prototype color palette is very dark and gloomy. Do you think it is appropriate or do you have any issues regarding this matter?
7. Were there any other issues you noticed or wanted to comment on?
8. Any suggestions to improve the gameplay?
